## Installation

To get started with **bufplugin-go**, you need to install it. You can do this using Go modules. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
go get github.com/upp-designer/bufplugin-go

## Usage

Here is a simple example to illustrate how to use **bufplugin-go** in your application.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "github.com/upp-designer/bufplugin-go"
)
